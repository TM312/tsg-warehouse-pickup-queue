# Phase 19: Dashboard Refactoring - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Refactor index.vue (410 lines) into maintainable, well-organized code with clear separation of concerns. This is internal code quality work — no visual or functional changes. Prepares codebase for Phase 20 (Gates View) and Phase 21 (Dashboard Polish).

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User delegated all refactoring decisions to Claude. Apply Vue/Nuxt best practices:
- Component extraction strategy (KPI cards, chart, queue table, processing section)
- File organization and naming conventions
- State management boundaries (page-level vs store)
- Code grouping and logical organization

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — apply standard refactoring practices and follow existing codebase patterns.
