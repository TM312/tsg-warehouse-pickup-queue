# Requirements: Warehouse Pickup Queue v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-30
**Core Value:** Customers always know their queue position and which gate to go to

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for Gate Operator Experience milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Gate Operator View

- [x] **GATE-01**: Gate operator can view current pickup at their gate (/gate/[id] route)
- [x] **GATE-02**: Sales order number displayed prominently (large, scannable text)
- [x] **GATE-03**: Customer name/company shown for verification
- [x] **GATE-04**: Quick action to mark pickup as complete (single tap)
- [x] **GATE-05**: Quick action to start processing (accepts current pickup)

- [x] **GATE-07**: Real-time updates when queue changes
- [x] **GATE-08**: Next-up preview shows who's coming after current customer
- [x] **GATE-09**: Order details displayed (item count, PO# from NetSuite cache)

### Processing Status

- [x] **PROC-01**: New "processing" status between queued and completed
- [x] **PROC-02**: Visual indicator for processing status (StatusBadge update)
- [x] **PROC-03**: Processing timestamp recorded (started_at column)
- [x] **PROC-04**: Customer notified when their pickup enters processing (passive: status page shows "Your order is being processed at Gate X")
- [x] **PROC-05**: Auto-advance to next pickup after completing current

### Business Hours Management

- [x] **HOUR-01**: Weekly schedule editor (7-day grid with time pickers)
- [x] **HOUR-02**: Holiday/closure date scheduling (shadcn-vue date picker)
- [x] **HOUR-03**: View current configured hours
- [x] **HOUR-04**: Hours changes take effect immediately (no deploy required)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

- **HOUR-07**: Copy schedule (clone hours between days)
- **HOUR-08**: Recurring holidays (set once, repeats annually)
- **HOUR-09**: Closure message customization

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Operator login per gate | Adds complexity, operators share gates — use existing staff auth |
| Gate-specific permissions | All staff have equal access (existing constraint) |
| Automatic gate assignment | Complex algorithm rarely optimal — keep manual |
| Separate operator mobile app | Maintenance burden — mobile-responsive web page instead |
| Processing time SLAs | Over-engineering for 50-100 daily pickups |
| Offline mode | Requires significant architecture changes (existing constraint) |
| Push notifications | Complex setup, web notifications unreliable — rely on realtime updates |

## Traceability
