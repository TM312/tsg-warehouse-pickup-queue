# Requirements: Warehouse Pickup Queue v2.1

**Defined:** 2026-02-03
**Core Value:** Customers always know their queue position and which gate to go to

## v2.1 Requirements

Dashboard polish and gates view — fixing UX issues and completing the gates management experience.

### Action Fixes

- [x] **FIX-01**: DataTable actions respect processing state — Processing orders show Complete + Return to Queue
- [x] **FIX-02**: Cancel action is secondary throughout all states

### Gates View

- [x] **GATE-14**: Gates overview page exists at /gates route
- [x] **GATE-15**: Gates page shows table with all gates and their status
- [x] **GATE-16**: Gates page provides links to individual gate operator views (/gate/[id])
- [x] **GATE-17**: "Manage gates" functionality (create/enable/disable) lives on /gates route

### Dashboard Improvements

- [x] **DASH-06**: Dashboard tabs contain only queue filtering (All, Gate 1, Gate 2, etc.)
- [x] **DASH-07**: "Now processing" section shows table with one row per active gate
- [x] **DASH-08**: Processing table shows order info or "Idle" state per gate

### Code Quality

- [x] **ARCH-10**: index.vue refactored following DRY principle
- [x] **ARCH-11**: index.vue has clear separation of concerns (components extracted where appropriate)
